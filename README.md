# Spin up the project

- Clone the template project to your local:
```git
git clone https://github.com/bluehackrafestefano/WeatherAppStarterTemplate.git
```

- Use the folder created after clone as the project main directory, cd to this new directory.

- Create virtual environment as a best practice:
```py
python3 -m venv env # for Windows or
python -m venv env # for Windows
virtualenv env # for Mac/Linux or;
virtualenv env -p python3 # for Mac/Linux
```

- Activate scripts:
```bash
.\env\Scripts\activate  # for Windows
source env/bin/activate  # for MAC/Linux
```

- See the (env) sign before your command prompt.

- Install dependencies:
```py
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
